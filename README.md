The easiest and fastest way to create your new Web project.

_This is the SETjs RealWorld demo._

## Documentation
[SetJS](https://github.com/stateempire) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API

You can find the SETjs documentation [on our website](https://setjs.org/docs). And check out our [Getting Started](https://setjs.org/docs/getting-started) page for details on trying SETjs yourself.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with SETjs including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the SETjs community styleguides & best practices.
